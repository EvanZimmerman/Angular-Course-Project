# Angular Course Project (Udemy)

This project was produced by Udemy.com.  Throughout the course, we analyzed core concepts and theory behind each one.  Once the foundations of these concepts were discussed, we put them in practical use by building a full-featured Angular application to help solidify the theory for each concept.  I want to state formally that this application was NOT designed, but simply implemented given guidelines from Udemy.  I found this application to be extremely insightful for my personal knowledge of this technology.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
